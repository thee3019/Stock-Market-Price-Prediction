# Stock-Market-Price-Prediction


Conducted comprehensive analysis of NYSE stock market prices of AAPL, AMZN and GE using advanced statistical models including LSTM, Linear regression, Support vector machine, ARIMA and K-means clustering to predict future trends.

Utilized evaluation metrics such as r-squared errors and MSE to compare the performance of different models for supervised learning, ultimately identifying LSTM as the most effective model with a 92% accuracy rate.

Employed unsupervised learning models such as K-means clustering to compute silhouette scores and evaluate their effectiveness in predicting stock trends, leading to a successful prediction rate of 85%.
